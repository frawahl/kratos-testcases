|SMALLEST CUTS| > 1e-7

AMGCL does not converge vor DYNAMIC_VISCOSITY below 1e-13

No treatment does not converge (because negative elements are ACTIVE?)
DistMod'1e-12 same as DistMod'1e-7 (see SMALLEST_CUT)

DistMod'1e-7 gives visually same results as Rub√©n got ("A modified Finite Element formulation for the imposition of the slip
boundary condition over embedded volumeless geometries", p.145), 1min:42s

MLSConstraints: visually same result, 7min:46s

LocalConstraints: visually same result, 1min:45s

LocalBCConstraints: visually same result, 1min:46s



|SMALLEST CUTS| < 1e-11

no instabilities, visually all the same
